# CLI handbook

The main way to use **resomapper** is through a command-line interface (CLI), which allows users to easily follow the complete image processing pipeline. To use this CLI, after installing the package, simply open a terminal window, enter the `resomapper_cli` command and press {kbd}`enter`.

```
> resomapper_cli
```

This will start the processing workflow, following several steps:

1. {ref}`start_cli`
2. {ref}`convert_studies`
3. {ref}`preprocessing`


(start_cli)=
## Choosing root folder

(convert_studies)=
## Convert raw studies to NIfTI

(preprocessing)=
## Preprocessing
